# Xelma Contract — Canonical Event Schema

This document is the authoritative reference for all events emitted by the Xelma smart contract.
Indexers, explorers, and client libraries must use these definitions to avoid incompatible
field assumptions.

---

## Versioning strategy

Events are versioned by **schema version tag** in the documentation rather than on-chain.
Breaking field changes will increment the schema version and are announced in `MIGRATION.md`.
Additive changes (new optional events) do not increment the version.

Current schema version: **v1**

## Encoding conventions

| Field type   | On-chain encoding                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `u32`        | Raw unsigned 32-bit integer                            |
| `u64`        | Raw unsigned 64-bit integer                            |
| `u128`       | Raw unsigned 128-bit integer                           |
| `i128`       | Raw signed 128-bit integer                             |
| `Address`    | Soroban `Address` (account or contract)                |
| `bool`       | Soroban boolean                                        |

**Amount units**: all token amounts are in stroops (1 vXLM = 10 000 000 stroops, 7 decimal places).

**Price units**: prices are scaled to **4 decimal places** (e.g., 0.2297 XLM → `2297`).

**Ledger sequence**: `u32` counter that increments with each Stellar ledger (~5 s/ledger).

**Timestamp**: Unix epoch seconds (`u64`), sourced from oracle payload or `env.ledger().timestamp()`.

---

## Topic encoding

Each event carries exactly **two topics**, both `Symbol` values.  
They form the canonical `(namespace, action)` pair used for filtering.

---

### `("outcome", "loss")`

*Additive change added by Issue #168 — schema version stays at **v1**
(additive events do not trigger a version bump per the versioning policy
at the top of this file).*

Emitted per losing participant whenever a round settles competitively
(Issue #168).  Complements the implicit "winner" signal from pending-winnings
accumulation and the explicit `("round", "fallback")` refund event so that
analytics, user notifications, and indexers can detect losses without
inferring them from the absence of payout events.

The payload shape is unified across both modes; the `mode` field selects which
metadata field is meaningful:

- **UpDown mode (`mode = 0`):** `side` is the user's losing direction
  (`0` = Up, `1` = Down). `predicted_price` is fixed at `0`.
- **Precision mode (`mode = 1`):** `predicted_price` is the user's guess in the
  4-decimal price scale. `side` is fixed at `0`. Participants who only
  committed (and did not reveal) carry `predicted_price = 0` because the
  guess is unknowable on-chain until reveal.

Emitted for every participant who placed a bet/prediction and was on the
losing side of a competitive settlement. **Not** emitted for refund paths
(price-unchanged, one-sided pool, min-participants fallback, or admin
cancellation) — those cases use their respective refund events instead.

| Position | Field            | Type      | Description                                                              |
|----------|------------------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0        | `user`           | `Address` | Address of the losing participant                                        |
| 1        | `round_id`       | `u64`     | Round the loss occurred in                                               |
| 2        | `mode`           | `u32`     | Round mode: `0` = UpDown, `1` = Precision                                |
| 3        | `amount`         | `i128`    | Stake amount the user committed (in stroops); the amount they lose       |
| 4        | `side`           | `u32`     | UpDown losing side (`0` = Up, `1` = Down). `0` for Precision mode        |
| 5        | `predicted_price`| `u128`    | Precision guess (4 decimal places). `0` for UpDown mode or unrevealed   |

## Example decode mappings

### JavaScript / TypeScript example: filter for losses

```typescript
import { xdr, scValToNative } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

function decodeOutcomeLoss(contractEvent: xdr.DiagnosticEvent) {
  const topics = contractEvent.event().body().v0().topics();
  const ns = scValToNative(topics[0]);
  const action = scValToNative(topics[1]);
  if (ns !== "outcome" || action !== "loss") return null;
  const data = scValToNative(contractEvent.event().body().v0().data());
  // [user, round_id, mode, amount, side, predicted_price]
  return { type: "loss", ...data };
}
```

---

### JavaScript / TypeScript (Stellar SDK)

```typescript
import { xdr, scValToNative } from "@stellar/stellar-sdk";

function decodeEvent(contractEvent: xdr.DiagnosticEvent) {
  const topics = contractEvent.event().body().v0().topics();
  const ns = scValToNative(topics[0]) as string;    // e.g. "round"
  const action = scValToNative(topics[1]) as string; // e.g. "created"
  const data = scValToNative(contractEvent.event().body().v0().data());
  return { ns, action, data };
}
```

### Rust (soroban-sdk test utilities)

```rust
use soroban_sdk::{symbol_short, testutils::{Events, TryIntoVal}, Env};

let events = env.events().all();
let resolved = events.iter().find(|(_, topics, _)| {
    topics.get(0).and_then(|t| t.try_into_val(&env).ok()) == Some(symbol_short!("round"))
        && topics.get(1).and_then(|t| t.try_into_val(&env).ok()) == Some(symbol_short!("resolved"))
});
```

# Contributing to Xelma-Blockchain

Thanks for improving Xelma. This document explains the expected workflow for contributors and maintainers.

## Before You Start

- Open or reference an issue describing the change.
- Keep changes focused and easy to review.
- For contract changes, include or update tests.

## Filing Issues

Blank issues are disabled. Pick the template that matches your work so every
backlog item ships with the technical detail maintainers need to triage it:

- **Bug report** — a reproducible defect in contract, bindings, or CI.
- **Feature request** — a general enhancement to logic, tooling, or docs.
- **Protocol improvement** — changes to contract logic, economics, or lifecycle.
- **Security hardening task** — public, non-sensitive defense-in-depth work.
  (Never disclose exploitable vulnerabilities publicly — use the private path
  in `SUPPORT.md`.)
- **Test task** — additional unit, property, chaos, or benchmark coverage.

The protocol, security, and test templates require **risk**, **scope**,
**acceptance criteria**, and a **test plan**. Issues missing these fields may be
sent back for detail before they are picked up.

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Install Rust and Node.js dependencies.
3. Run local validation before opening a PR:
   - `cargo test --workspace`
   - `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings`
   - `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
   - `cd bindings && npm ci && npm run build`
   - `cd bindings && npm run test:parity` (ABI drift check; mirrors the CI `bindings-test` job)

Before opening a PR, consult [`docs/CONTRIBUTOR_TASK_MATRIX.md`](./docs/CONTRIBUTOR_TASK_MATRIX.md) for task-type-specific test and evidence requirements.

## Security Checks (local)

The CI `security-audit` job runs two checks that maintainers and contributors can reproduce locally.

### 1. Dependency vulnerability scan

```bash
# Install once
# Install once (pin matches CI CARGO_AUDIT_VERSION in .github/workflows/ci.yml)
cargo install cargo-audit --version 0.22.2 --locked

# Run from the repo root
cargo audit --deny warnings
```

Findings map to RustSec advisories. A non-zero exit means at least one advisory-level issue
was found. Review the output and update or replace the affected crate, or add an `audit.toml`
ignore entry with a justification comment if the advisory does not apply to this project.

### 2. Security-oriented clippy lints

```bash
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets --locked -- \
  -D clippy::unwrap_used \
  -D clippy::expect_used \
  -D clippy::panic \
  -D clippy::integer_arithmetic \
  -W clippy::arithmetic_side_effects \
  -W clippy::cast_possible_truncation \
  -W clippy::cast_sign_loss
```

These lints catch patterns that are benign in general Rust but unsafe in smart-contract
contexts (silent panics, unchecked integer operations, sign-loss on casts).  CI treats them
as warnings that are surfaced in the audit job output; errors `-D` will fail the job.

> **Note**: These lints are stricter than the standard `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` run in
> the `rust-test` job. It is normal for code that passes standard clippy to have findings here.
> Fix or document each finding before merging contract changes.

## Canonical Contract Crate

The contract crate name is `xelma-contract`. Do not reintroduce legacy crate naming in build scripts, docs, or CI commands.

## Pull Request Expectations

- Link the issue(s) the PR closes.
- Describe behavioral impact and migration assumptions.
- Include test evidence for the changed behavior.
- Keep generated build artifacts out of commits (`target/`, `bindings/dist/`, etc.).
- For contract ABI, storage, or event changes, classify the impact (MAJOR/MINOR/PATCH) using [COMPATIBILITY_POLICY.md](./COMPATIBILITY_POLICY.md) and bump `Cargo.toml` accordingly.

## Review and Merge Policy

- At least one maintainer approval is required for non-trivial changes.
- Contract, CI, or release workflow changes require review from a listed code owner.
- Maintainers may request follow-up hardening before merge when security or correctness risk exists.

## Security Reporting

Do not open public issues for vulnerabilities. Follow the process in `SUPPORT.md` and repository security policy/disclosure instructions.
